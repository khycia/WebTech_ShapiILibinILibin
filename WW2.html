      <h5>The War Years</h5>
      <p>The 1940s tower over every other decade of the 20th century as the most full of sorrow, patriotism, and ultimately, hope and the beginning of a new era of American dominance on the world stage. This decade, commonly called "the war years," is synonymous with World War II.  This decade left an indelible mark on all but the youngest of Americans that lasted for the rest of their lives. Those who were young and were in the military were dubbed "The Greatest Generation" by former NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and the moniker stuck. Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, and the war dominated Europe from that moment until the Nazis surrendered. The United States was drawn into World War II with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and was then involved in both the European and Pacific theaters until peace came in May 1945 in Europe and August of that year in the Pacific.</p>

      <h5>The Ending</h5>
      <p>World War II ended in Europe and the Pacific in 1945, and those two events dominated this year. Leading up to the end of the war, there was the firebombing of Dresden and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. Hitler committed suicide, the Germans and the Japanese surrendered. The Yalta Conference brought together the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill; FDR died just before the war ended in Europe; a firestorm consumed Tokyo; and Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who saved thousands of Jewish lives, was arrested and never seen again.</p>
      <p>The Nuremberg trials began, the United Nations was founded, and Korea was divided into North and South Korea. In the inventions department, the first computer was built, the microwave was invented, and the slinky toys made their first appearance.</p>
